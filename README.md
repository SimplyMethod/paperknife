# Paperknife

Manage your product roadmaps/changelog/updates and help your users to stay up to date with Paperknife.

## Philosophy

### Simple and easy to use

Paperknife is designed for indie developers, which means it should be as simple as possible to use, as well as easy to deploy and maintain, as well as being able to host it with a reasonable and affordable budget.

The database schema design is simple and easy to understand, each workspace has its own database, and each workspace has its own users, which means you can manage multiple products in one place.

### Multiple workspaces

If you're an indie developer, you may have multiple products, and you may want to manage them in one place. Paperknife supports multiple workspaces, which means you can manage all of your products in one place.

### Free, no lock-in. Host your own

Paperknife is open source, which means you can host your own instance with your own server, and you can also contribute to the project or fork it to build your own product.

## Tech Stack

To keep it simple, Paperknife is built with the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - One of most popular React framework, which means it's easy to find correct answers when you have questions.
- [Drizzle ORM] - A simple and lightweight ORM for Node.js, which means it's easy to use and maintain.
- [SQLite] - A simple and lightweight database, which means it's easy to use and maintain.
- [Vercel] - A simple and lightweight hosting platform, which means it's easy to use and maintain.
